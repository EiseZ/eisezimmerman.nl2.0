    <h1>Eise Zimmerman (or IllicitPrism)</h1>
    <p>Well hello there, I am Eise, a passionate developer from the Netherlands!</p>
    <p>There are many different things I am interrested in, some of which include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <li>Baseball</li>
        <li>Bouldering</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Programming</h2>
    I like programming in my spare time. I have a lot of different projects I am working on at the moment.
    These range from web development, to writing operating systems, and everything in between.

    <h3>Linux</h3>
    I use the linux operating system on my main PC as well as my laptop.
    I like using tiling window managers and customizing my system exactly to the way I like it.
    Some of the tools I use include:<br>
    voidlinux, dwm, neovim, latex (but there change around every month)

    <h2>Sports</h2>
    I play baseball three times a week, and go bouldering 1 time every week.
    Last year our baseball team won in the poule.

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    I strongly believe in free (as in freedom) and ope source software, which is the primary reason I use Linux.
    I like all of my software to be minimal, yet configurable and customizable.
    There is fun to be found in customizing your workflow, saving those precious minutes every day.
